The book *Elegant Objects* by Yegor Bugayenko advocates for writing object-oriented code that is clean, maintainable, and truly object-oriented. 
One of its core principles is to always use interfaces instead of concrete classes when defining types. 
This approach encourages loose coupling, easier testing, and greater flexibility in code. 
By programming to interfaces, developers can swap implementations without changing client code, leading to more robust and adaptable systems. 
The book provides practical advice and examples to help developers embrace these principles in their Java projects.

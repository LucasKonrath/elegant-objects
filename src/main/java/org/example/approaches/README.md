The author of Elegant Objects, Yegor Bugayenko, highlights a key difference between declarative and imperative approaches in object-oriented programming. The imperative approach requires the developer to specify each step needed to achieve a result, often resulting in procedural code that is harder to maintain and extend. In contrast, the declarative approach focuses on describing the desired outcome, allowing objects to encapsulate the logic and make decisions internally. Bugayenko argues that the declarative style aligns better with object-oriented principles, leading to more elegant, flexible, and maintainable code.

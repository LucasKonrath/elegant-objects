The author of Elegant Objects, Yegor Bugayenko, is well-known for his strong opposition to the use of static methods in object-oriented programming. In his books and blog posts, he argues that static methods break the principles of encapsulation and object orientation, making code harder to test, extend, and maintain. According to him, static methods are essentially procedural and do not belong in true object-oriented design.

He advocates for designing code where behavior is encapsulated within objects, and dependencies are injected rather than accessed statically. This approach, he claims, leads to more elegant, flexible, and maintainable code.

For more details, see the Elegant Objects books or Yegor's blog posts on the topic.
